# IEEE Ionic Assessment

## Comments

* I used Ionic 4 for this assignment.

* I used Ionic Infinite Scroll to implement the list because we don't know the total number of records returned from the endpoint. Also, it hurts performance to render a huge number of records up front when users likely won't be needing them all.

* API returns a lot of data for each member. The requirement asks to highlight registration date, registration age and location. Since there is no visual spec, I figured the best way to highlight, or bring user's attention to those info, would be to show those info only. If that's not what the team expects, please let me know. I would be happy to revise my code.
